        I am doing my Masters in Automobile Engineering and i am working on
        project
        <span class="blog-project-name">
          Modelling and experimental study on a SI engine using LPG as an
          alternative fuel </span
        >.
      </p>

      <h2 class="second-heading-engine">Introduction</h2>
      <p class="font-size-engine">
        This project evaluated an experimental investigation on Liquefied
        Petroleum Gas(LPG) as an alternative fuel for four stroke spark ignition
        engine. The main objective of this project is to determine the
        performance and the exhaust emissions of the engine. we used a single
        cylinder, four-stroke spark ignition engine and some changes are carried
        out to permit the engine to run on LPG fuel. LPG is obtained from the
        process of natural gas and crude oil extraction. it has high octane
        number than petrol.
      </p>

      <h2 class="second-heading-engine">Experimental Setup Requirement</h2>
      <div>
        <ul class="blog-para-engine engine-requirements">
          <li>Carburetor</li>
          <li>LPG Gas Cylinder</li>
          <li>Gas Flow Meter</li>
          <li>Pressure Gauge</li>
          <li>Exhaust Gas Analyzer</li>
          <li>Gas Kit</li>
          <li>Dynamometer</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2 class="second-heading-engine">Test Procedure</h2>
      <p class="font-size-engine">
        The test engine was mounted on a steel structure and there is also the
        availabilty of dynamometer. Test setup and dynamoneter both are aligned
        at same height. The steel structure was placed on top of rubber to
        prevent or minimize the vibration. Connector is used to connect the
        engine and ropeway dynoamometer. The performance of the engine running
        on both gasoline(petrol) fuel and lpg fuel were determined from data
        obtained at dynamometer. Dynamometer is used to vary the laod
        measurement. we run the engine at variable load, variable rpm and
        variable compression ratio. A gas analyzer is also fixed at the exhaust
        pipe for the emission measurement. The analyzer has the capability of
        sampling exhaust products such as Hydrocarbon, carbon-monoxide,
        carbon-dioxide and oxygen and NOx.

      <h2 class="second-heading-engine">Advantage of LPG over Petrol</h2>
      <div>
        <ul class="blog-para-engine">
          <li>Running on LPG saves cost of about 50%</li>
          <li>In multi-cylinder we get uniform mixture to all cylinder</li>
          <li>lpg has high antiknock</li>
          <li>lpg mixes with air at all temperatures</li>
          <li>lpg contains less carbon than petrol</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2 class="second-heading-engine">Disadvantage of LPG over Petrol</h2>

      <div>
        <ul class="blog-para-engine">
          <li>Some modification in fuel feed system is required</li>
          <li>vehicle weight increased</li>
          <li>good cooling system is required</li>
          <li>lpg produce less horse power than petrol at full throttle</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2 class="second-heading-engine">Future Scope for LPG Vehicles</h2>

      <p class="font-size-engine">
        Cost saving, longer life of the engine and less emission will attract
        the public for making use of LPG vehicles. Many countries use LPG fuel
        in the vehicles. weight of the cylinder is the disadvantage, some amount
        of power is wasted in carrying these cylinders. there is also a option
        of blending the lpg fuel with gasoline fuel. it will increase the
        performance characteristics and minimize the emissions characteristics.
        safety should be the priority for lpg vehicles as cylinder can explode.
